# CatDetector
A browser userscript that detects famous people throughout history who were cat fans
This userscript is based off the famous coincidence detector userscript/extension https://coincidencedetector.com/

keep in mind that this script is still a work in progress and it's probably not yet functional
I just started learning javascript so gimme a break plz :^)
